# Farm-Defender
<p> Farm Defender is a third person shooter game developed by Jett Ji and Jennifer Huang of Commonwealth Enterprise. The objective of the game is too prevent the invaders coming from the right side of the screen to the left side. While doing that you must ensure the animals don't get shot. Shooting 3 animals will result in a "Game Over" as well as allowing 3 invaders pass. </p>
